# nagonbot


nagonbot is an attempt at recreating a chat-bot project by [Neural Nine] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1lwddP0KUEg) with the exception that this bot is programmed in Japanese. The name is reference to a Heian period japanese writer.

The bot is fully functional, but I'll still make some improvements to make it even better.
